            Last Mile Delivery Management System (LMDMS) is a web application that will help the courier managers to manage the vehicles and deliveries in a simpler and easier way. The database will keep track of the consignments (yet to be delivered, delivered and returned), drivers, vehicles, fuel allocations to the drivers for the vehicles, and vehicle assignments to the drivers etc.
